# How Web Works
What happens behind the scenes when we type github.com in a browser?

###  1. URL parsing :-
* The browser parses the information contained in the URL. This includes the protocol (“https”), the domain name (“github.com”) and the resource (“/”).
* Anything after ".com" is a specific resource located on the server.( like home page)

### 2. DNS Lookup :-
* The first step in the navigation is to figure out the IP address for the visited domain.
* Each domain name (eg. youtube.com / google.com) is mapped to a particular IP address and the DNS (Domain Name Server) contains the list of records which maps a particular domain name to it's unique IP address.
